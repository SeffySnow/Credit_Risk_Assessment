# Credit_Risk_Assessment

This notebook presents a comprehensive data analysis on credit risk assessment using loan application data. It includes a step-by-step exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between borrower attributes (such as income, age, loan amount, and interest rate) and their repayment status (fully repaid or defaulted).
Based on the insights from EDA, a Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict the likelihood of loan repayment for new applicants, achieving a final accuracy of 93%
